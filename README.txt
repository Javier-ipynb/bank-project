# Project Title:
Prediction of Customer Behavior in Banking Campaigns

# Description:
The goal of this project is to create the best supervised machine learning model we can develop to predict whether a future customer might subscribe to the campaign being offered by the bank. Beyond that, we will also analyze certain hypotheses that arise from the data we have, providing a clear and specific analysis of what factors influence a customerâ€™s decision to subscribe to the campaign. The columns and their values are clearly explained within the project.

# Data Acquisition:
The data was obtained from the Kaggle website, which offers a variety of datasets for different projects. These datasets can sometimes be synthetic and may not reflect the reality of a population.

# Final Model Performance for the Specific Project:
The performance and its final metrics were aimed at obtaining the best possible model. However, I did not establish a large number of hyperparameters due to computational reasons. Despite this, I achieved some of the best metrics compared to other projects published on the same Kaggle page. Beyond just training the model or focusing on a specific metric, I conducted exploratory data analysis to evaluate the feature selection step by step, and understand the importance of the initial data imbalance. These points are explained in greater detail within the project.
